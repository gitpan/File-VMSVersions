File/VMSVersions version 0.1
============================

The File::VMSVersions module was developed for maintaining automatic
versioning of files in a directory. When you are using the module's routines for
opening files, it will keep a configurable amount of old versions. The versions
will be identified by a number that is added at the end of the filename after a
semicolon (i. e. 'myfile.dat;7').
